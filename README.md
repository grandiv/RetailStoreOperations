# Retail Store Operations: Agent-Based Model Simulation

**Description**:

This agent-based model simulation is written in Python using the MESA library for building, visualizing, and analyzing these complex simulations. There are different scenarios in a JSON format. Each scenario represents a retail store layout and contains the relative probabilities for categories. The higher the weight, the more likely an item in that category to be picked by customer. Modify the ```server.py``` inside the ```store``` folder to simulate different scenarios.
